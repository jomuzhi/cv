# Resume built using RMarkdown and the pagedown package - modified Nick Strayer's version

Modified with page number inserted, adjusted page margin --> modified .css files

Printed to PDF directly via pagedown::chrome_print --> modified .rmd files

Modified "position" .csv files with some new sections such as academic articles, awards, etc --> corresponding .rmd file change

The current file only includes resume .rmd codes, CV .rmd codes are almost identical as in Nick's file.

For more detailed instruction, please see [Nicker Strayer's Readme file and codes](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv).
