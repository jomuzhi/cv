# Pagedown rendered CV - modified Nick Strayer's version
CV built using RMarkdown and the pagedown package

Modified with page number inserted, printed to PDF directly via pagedown::chrome_print, and adjusted margin.

Some "position" csv files added new sections such as academic articles, awards, etc.

The current file only includes resume rmd codes, CV rmd codes are almost identical as in Nick's file.

For more detailed instruction, please see Nicker Strayer's [Readme file and other codes](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv)
